We are trying to communicate scientific exploration and discoveries more efficiently through the use of the Internet. We have discovered, through the Science Communication subject, that scientific blogs are very useful at delivering scientific information to the community.  We have therefore decided to use the search engine 'iFish' to help people look for various science blogs.  As a portal, iFish is a much more effective and efficient way for people in the community to search for scientific blogs that they are interested in, rather than other portals such as Google. This is because, with iFish, we can give people the ability to search specifically for blogs they may be interested in through the use of sliders and filters, instead of having to discover the traits of different blogs by themselves. Sliders aim to make a link between the personâ€™s personal preferences or tastes and the items they are exploring.
